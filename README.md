The original application was created for a graduation project called "Automatic Mini Tillage Machine" to control a small tillage machine designed and developed as part of the project. The control system on the tillage machine uses a microcontroller (ESP32) for control. Communication between the application and the tillage machine uses NETPIE (MQTT) services to receive and send commands over the Internet. The application is developed in Kotlin Language and uses Restful APIs (Retrofit 2) to communicate between the application and the platform.
